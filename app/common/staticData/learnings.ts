Erroneous code carelessly pushed into Github, breaking builds and slowing down deployments. Bad naming conventions. Unorganized and unused imports. Bad and vague commit message. Taking care of forgotten 'console.log' statements. Using the packages in the proper way will block the developer from making a successful commit so that they can learn being careful.",
